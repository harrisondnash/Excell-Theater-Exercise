# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To analyze the results of different fundraising campaigns in relation to thier launch dates and funding goals. The data set is specifically theater plays. Louise's play Fever came close to raising the desired amount in a short amount of time, but she wants insight through data. The dataset of theater plays was presented in spreadsheet format in Excel.

## Analysis and Challenges

To do this analysis, additional columns needed to be created within the spreadsheet in order to:
1. Separate fundraising subcategories from parent categories
2. normalize timestamp information
3. find the year that fundraising events occurred

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The goal was to find the outcomes of theater performances relative to the time of the year when were performed. Productions still in progress were not considered. A pivot table was used to look at ones who had a definitive outcome. The columns were: successful, failed, and canceled. Then, a chart was made to visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The objective was to find out success rate of plays based on thier financial budget. This information was charted on a third spreadsheet within the workbook. Looking at the data, we can conclude that many of the plays most successful were fairly low-budget (less than $5,000), with some on the higher end ($35,000 to $45,000). Then, a chart was made to visualize the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The pivot tables were difficult to set up in Excel. Deciding how best to filter that data and assign column, row, and values required trial and error.
Also I am not an Excel "power-user" by anymeans so finding my bearings required some time.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

    1. The ideal time to launch a production is May or June then July.
    2. The less or non-successful productions launch in the winter months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

    Productions with a lower fundraising goal tend to have a much higher success rate than those with higher fundraising goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

    Data that could contribute to a better dataset could include genre, target audience, and location. Also it would be ideal to widen the scope of time the dataset covered.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

    A box-and-whisker plot could help identify outliers by campaign type.
    Also, a simple bar graph could be used to visualize the percentages of each of the three possible outcomes per budget range.
